```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


For this practical, we will use data from a sample of the Teaching dataset of the Health Survey for England (2003-2005), which is
available [**here**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6765).

We will be fitting a series of binary logistic multilevel models for the probability of being overweight or obese.

The traditional measure used to determine whether an adult is overweight is the Body-Mass Index (BMI).

For an adult to be considered overweight, their BMI must be between 25 and 30. Meanwhile values over 30 are considered as "obese".

# Typical workflow setup and data preparation

## 1.1. Define a working directory

You can use any directory in your computer. As in the example below:

```{r, eval=F}
setwd("C:/myfolder")
```

Remember to download the data to the folder you will define as working directory, as this makes matters easier.

## 1.2. Load packages

You can always load packages later on, but it is a good practice to load packages at the beginning of the session on the top of your script or R markdown file.

In this practical, we will use the packages `haven`, `lme4` and `ggplot2`. Remember that if you haven't installed them before, you need to do so before you call the `library` function:

```{}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("haven")
install.packages("lme4")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("broom.mixed")
```

Then you load them as such:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(haven)
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom.mixed)
```

## 1.3. Read in data 

You can download the data from  the [**UKDS website**](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=6765). There are four files in different formats. We will be using the Stata dataset named: "hse_data_for_workshop.dta".

To read this dataset into R, we need to use the package `haven`:


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
hse <- read_dta("https://github.com/A-mora/MLM_summer-school/raw/main/data/hse_data_for_workshop.dta")
```

<br>

## Select variables to use

The dataset has many different variables, but we're not going to be using all of them, so for easier work, we will select the following: `year`, `pserial`, `area`, `bmival`, `sex`, `age` and `ethnic`.

`year` is the year where the measures were taken

`pserial` is the anonymised person identifier

`area` is the anonymised postcode of the person

`bmival` is the valid measure of BMI

`sex` coded 0 for Men and 1 for Women

`age` from 0 to 99

`ethnic` coded 1 for White; 
               2 for Mixed; 
               3 for Asian or Asian British; 
               4 for Black or Black British and 
               5 for Chinese or any other group

For a detailed description of these variables, have a look in the documentation downloaded alongside with the data. 
**Spoiler alert:** You will also find a complete set of materials for a workshop on MLM.

To select variables, we (unsurprisingly) need to use the function `select` of the `dplyr` package:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

hse2 <- select(hse, year, pserial, area, bmival, sex, age, ethnic, bmival) 

```

<br>

***
# Preliminary tasks

We need to dichotomise our dependent variable `bmival`. As we mentioned before, the categories "overweight" and "obese" are for those with a BMI over 25 and 30, respectively, so we need to do the following to our continuous BMI measure:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
hse2$bmi_bin <- ifelse(hse2$bmival >= 25, 1, 0)
```

To check this is done correctly, you can run a simple frequency table:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
table(hse2$bmi_bin)
```

If there are more than two values there, then something must have gone wrong.

Also, given that the BMI in children is done differently, we will remove all under-18 individuals. We do this by typing:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
hse2 <- hse2 %>% filter(age>18)
```

# Task 1: Fit an empty model

We will start by fitting an empty multilevel model for the propensity of being overweight in people nested in areas.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
empty <- glmer(bmi_bin ~ 1 + (1|area), data = hse2, family = binomial("logit"))

summary(empty)
```


<br>

### Questions:

1.1 What is the overall probability of being overweight?

Remember this formula:

$$logit(p_i)=\log\left(\frac{p_{i}}{1-p_{i}}\right)$$
To get the odds from the estimated coefficients, you use the exponent function:

$$exp(\beta)=odds$$

Then, to convert to probability, you can do this:

$$p = \frac{odds}{1 + odds}$$
```{r, warning=F, message=F}

odds <- exp(empty@beta) # this is to retrieve the intercept from the model

prob <- odds/(1 + odds) # to estimate the overall probability

prob # to print the result to the screen
```


1.2 What is the VPC for this model?

$$VPC = \frac{\sigma_u^2}{\sigma_u^2 + \sigma_e^2*}$$
where $\sigma_e^2*= \frac{\pi^2}{3} \approx 3.29$

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
lev2var <- as.numeric(VarCorr(empty)) # this is to retrieve the level 2 variance from the model

(lev2var)/(lev2var+3.29) # VPC
```

<br>

***

# Task 2: Is the MLM better than a single-level model?

To assess the statistical significance of the MLM, we need to compare it to a single-level model. To fit a single-level model, we type:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

single <- glm(bmi_bin ~ 1 , data = hse2, family = binomial("logit"))

summary(single)

```

These results are not very interesting in themselves, so we move on extract the loglikelihood and compare to the MLM.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

L1 <- as.numeric(logLik(single)) # store this as numerical to re-use
L2 <- as.numeric(logLik(empty))

(D <- 2*(L2-L1)) # this is the deviance, we put it within brackets to print it immediately

pchisq(q=D, df=1, lower.tail=F) # To find the p-value

```

### Question

2.1. Is the addition of the area level statistically significant?

2.2. What does this mean in practice?

***

# Task 3: Random intercepts model

Just like in the case of normally-distributed responses, we can fit a `random intercepts` model by adding explanatory variables.

We want to find out whether there any differences between males and females on the probability of being overweight.

```{r, warning=T, message=F}
rand_int <- glmer(bmi_bin ~ factor(sex) + (1|area), data = hse2, family = binomial("logit"))

summary(rand_int)
```

We can also get a more "human-readable" version of the table of coefficients by using the package `broom.mixed`:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
(m1 <- tidy(rand_int, effects = "fixed",
          conf.int=TRUE, 
          exponentiate=FALSE))
```

You can plot these for easier inspection:

```{r}
(m1_plot <- 
    ggplot(m1, 
           mapping = aes(x= estimate,
                         y = term, 
                         xmin = conf.low, 
                         xmax = conf.high)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "tomato", size =1) +
    geom_pointrange() +
    theme_classic())
```

If you want to obtain the odds ratios, you can change the option `exponentiate` to `TRUE`.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
(m1_odds <- tidy(rand_int, effects = "fixed",
          conf.int=TRUE, 
          exponentiate=TRUE))
```

Unsurprisingly, you can plot the odds for easier inspection:

```{r}
(m1_odds_plot <- 
    ggplot(m1_odds, 
           mapping = aes(x= estimate,
                         y = term, 
                         xmin = conf.low, 
                         xmax = conf.high)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = "tomato", size =1) +
    geom_pointrange() +
    theme_classic())
```

### Question:

3.1. What is the effect of sex on being overweight?

3.2. What is the probability of a female being overweight in this sample?

***

# Task 4: Area-specific estimates

Just like in task 5 of practical 2, we can retrieve the residuals from the `random intercepts` and plot them to find out which areas have more or less than average people who are overweight.

This is what is sometimes called in the literature a "Caterpillar plot".

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
m2 <- tidy(rand_int, effects = "ran_vals",
          conf.int=TRUE,
          exponentiate=FALSE)

(RE <- m2 %>%
    mutate(level = fct_reorder(level, estimate)) %>%
    ggplot( mapping = aes(x= estimate,
                         y = level, 
                         xmin = conf.low, 
                         xmax = conf.high)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "tomato", size =1) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "logit",
         y = "Areas") +
    geom_pointrange() +
    theme_classic())

```

### Question:

4.1. Are there any areas that are significantly above or below average?

***

# Additional tasks

You can borrow from practical 2 and repeat some of the tasks there, such as:

- adding more explanatory variables 

- adding interaction effects

- plot predictions.
